# 🔥 Calories Burnt Prediction

This machine learning project predicts the number of calories burnt based on inputs like gender, age, height, weight, heart rate, body temperature, and duration of activity. Built using Python and scikit-learn, this regression model helps estimate energy expenditure for fitness tracking.
